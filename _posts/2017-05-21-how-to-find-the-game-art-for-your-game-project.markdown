I am currently working on a game development, i do programming and in the game if i require graphics then i hire designer. I was curious about how other indie developers like me manage the game assets. I asked in a Facebook group about this topic. Hopefully i got reply from Dozens of people. In this post i will share how they manage the game assets being a Game Programmer.

I will try to provide the link and their serious ideas to manage game art for your project.
<ol>
	<li>Some said that they would hire freelancer for entire art of their game.</li>
	<li>Some said that they would find free/open-source game art in the places like: <a href="https://opengameart.org/">OpenGameArt.org</a>, <a href="http://kenney.nl/assets">Kenney.nl</a>, <a href="http://www.gameart2d.com/">GameArt2d</a></li>
	<li>Some said that they would buy the Assets from stores like: <a href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com">Unity Asset Store</a>, <a href="https://graphicriver.net/">GraphicRiver</a></li>
	<li>Some said that first they make a rough art and develop the game and eventually while releasing they would hire freelancer graphics designer.</li>
	<li>Some said that they have started to learn them self and they are doing great. Also some said that it is little easier to learn 8-bit style art. (<a href="http://www.2dgameartguru.com">2DGameArtGuru</a>)</li>
	<li>Some said that they would partnership with designer to build the game and share the credit and earnings.</li>
	<li>Some said that they would just focus on game with art that is geometric shapes like square, triangles etc.</li>
</ol>
In this post i have shared the idea and link form my post thread only. There are many out there. I hope this will give you at least a basic idea for finding game art for your project.
