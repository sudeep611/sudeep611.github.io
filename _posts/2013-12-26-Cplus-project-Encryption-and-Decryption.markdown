As a project in C++ during my College, i choose Encryption and Decryption as my project. I am implemented very simple technique for Encryption and Decryption.

The encryption and decryption is done on the basis of letter shifting method.

For example if the encryption key is 5 then for the word A the value of A after will be F.

If you are unclear about what i am talking then seeing my source code will make you understand what i am talking about.

Source Code @ [github].

I hope you will be able to understand this code easily. If not then don’t forget to write to me.
