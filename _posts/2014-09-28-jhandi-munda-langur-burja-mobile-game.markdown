Jhandi Munda is a gambling game played mostly in South Asian countries including Nepal, India, Bangladesh and Myanmar. It is also known with a different name in different regions such as "Langur Burja", "Jhanda Burja” and “Khor Khore” or “Khod khode”. I have developed a Mobile game based on this.

Jhandi Munda is mostly played during Hindu’s big festivals like Dussehra(Dashain) and Deepawali(Tihar). We have 6 dices with 6 faces in each die. Different places might have different rules for playing. However, the dices are the same and most rules are common among all of us.

In this age of technology where people spend more time on their mobile phones, I have developed this game for Mobile phone. For now, it is available in Google Playstore and will be available in the App Store for Apple devices.
