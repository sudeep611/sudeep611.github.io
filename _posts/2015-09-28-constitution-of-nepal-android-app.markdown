It's been so great to feel that the Constitution of Nepal has finally arrived. Congratulations to all the Nepalese. May this Constitution brings peace, prosperity and rapid development in the country is the wish of all the Nepalese.

On this occasion with the intention of easy distribution of Constitution and making available of Constitution in the hand of all the people, I have developed an Android app to read the Constitution.

It is available on Google Play
