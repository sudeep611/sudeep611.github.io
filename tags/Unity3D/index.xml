      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jhandi Munda is a gambling game played mostly in South Asian countries including Nepal, India, Bangladesh and Myanmar. It is also known with a different name in different regions such as &amp;ldquo;Langur Burja&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Jhanda Burja” and “Khor Khore” or “Khod khode”. I have developed a Mobile game based on this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
