Useful when there are many same animation running on screen and you want to make them random.&#xA;Animator anim = GetComponent&amp;lt;Animator&amp;gt; (); AnimatorStateInfo state = anim.GetCurrentAnimatorStateInfo (0); anim.Play (state.fullPathHash, -1, Random.Range(0f,1f)); You can add this code in Start or Awake function and add to the GameObject with the Animator component.</description>

      <description>Jhandi Munda is a gambling game played mostly in South Asian countries including Nepal, India, Bangladesh and Myanmar. It is also known with a different name in different regions such as &amp;ldquo;Langur Burja&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Jhanda Burja” and “Khor Khore” or “Khod khode”. I have developed a Mobile game based on this.&#xA;Jhandi Munda is mostly played during Hindu’s big festivals like Dussehra(Dashain) and Deepawali(Tihar). We have 6 dices with 6 faces in each die.</description>
