      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently i was having multiple issues with google play games plugin integration in Unity. It was not working at all. After spending the couple of hours in it, i was able to fix the issue. This is a note to myself as well for others who are having trouble with the integration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am currently working on a game development, i do programming and in the game if i require graphics then i hire designer. I was curious about how other indie developers like me manage the game assets. I asked in a Facebook group about this topic. Hopefully i got reply from Dozens of people. In this post i will share how they manage the game assets being a Game Programmer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jhandi Munda is a gambling game played mostly in South Asian countries including Nepal, India, Bangladesh and Myanmar. It is also known with a different name in different regions such as &amp;ldquo;Langur Burja&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Jhanda Burja” and “Khor Khore” or “Khod khode”. I have developed a Mobile game based on this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
