      <description>I deleted the archive file which contains important images. And i thought it was gone forever, i did not had any backup too. But i was able to restore the deleted archive file using NtfsUndelete.&#xA;It was good that i had archived the photos so it was easy to restore. I was using Ubuntu and i deleted the files that was from another drive which is using Ntfs file system. So, i will explain how i was able to recover my files.</description>
