      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am the graduated Student of Gandaki College of Engineering and Science of Batch 2012 and the faculty is Bachelor of Engineering in Software Engineering.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last year in October, 2016, the final Semester examination was completed. And then the result arrived after about 3 months. The 14th convocation ceremony of Pokhara University was held in 20th of February 2017. The convocation was a great memory and experience for me since there was no such day in the past when i did my SLC and Plus two(High school). There used to be a small farewell program conducted by School after the completion. But this convocation after completing the bachelor is great day to remember.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
