      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been so great to feel that the Constitution of Nepal has finally arrived. Congratulations to all the Nepalese. May this Constitution brings peace, prosperity and rapid development in the country is the wish of all the Nepalese.&#xA;On this occasion with the intention of easy distribution of Constitution and making available of Constitution in the hand of all the people, I have developed an Android app to read the Constitution.</description>

      <description>Jhandi Munda is a gambling game played mostly in South Asian countries including Nepal, India, Bangladesh and Myanmar. It is also known with a different name in different regions such as &amp;ldquo;Langur Burja&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Jhanda Burja” and “Khor Khore” or “Khod khode”. I have developed a Mobile game based on this.&#xA;Jhandi Munda is mostly played during Hindu’s big festivals like Dussehra(Dashain) and Deepawali(Tihar). We have 6 dices with 6 faces in each die.</description>
